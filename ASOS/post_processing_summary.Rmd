Herein lies a final quality check of the AK ASOS data, post-correction for instrumentation bias.  

Some items that have come up during the processing of these data:  
* Extreme adjustments from quantile mapping
* Differences in "discreteness" between periods (present in raw data?)
* High speeds (e.g. > 30): are they legit?

### Data "discreteness"
Plotting ECDFs reveals many different step sizes. Just want to verify that this is legit. 
```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(echo = FALSE)

knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "../..")
# directories
workdir <- knitr::opts_knit$get("root.dir")
datadir <- file.path(workdir, "data")
asos_adj_dir <- file.path(datadir, "AK_ASOS_stations_adj")


```




```{r }


```




```{r }



```
