##CM3 January
There is a correlation between the following quantile and mean differences of `r round(cor(cm3_jan_df$q99.00_diff, cm3_jan_df$mean_diff), 2)` for the 99.00% quantiles, and `r round(cor(cm3_jan_df$q99.90_diff, cm3_jan_df$mean_diff), 2)` for the 99.90% quantiles. 
```{r cm3_jan, echo = FALSE}

##CM3 July
There is a correlation between the following quantile and mean differences of `r round(cor(cm3_jul_df$q99.00_diff, cm3_jul_df$mean_diff), 2)` for the 99.00% quantiles, and `r round(cor(cm3_jul_df$q99.90_diff, cm3_jul_df$mean_diff), 2)` for the 99.90% quantiles.
